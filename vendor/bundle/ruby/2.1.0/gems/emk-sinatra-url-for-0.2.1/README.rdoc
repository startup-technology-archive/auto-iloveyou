= sinatra-url-for

<code>sinatra-url-for</code> can be used by a Sinatra application to
construct absolute paths and full URLs.

To install it, run:

  sudo gem install emk-sinatra-url-for -s http://gems.github.com

To include it in a Sinatra application, write:

  require 'rubygems'
  gem 'emk-sinatra-url-for'
  require 'sinatra/url_for'

Once this is done, you should be able to call +url_for+ from within a
request.  Assuming that your application is running on
<code>example.com</code>, and that it has been mapped to
<code>/myapp</code>, you should get:

  url_for "/"            # Returns "/myapp/"
  url_for "/foo"         # Returns "/myapp/foo"
  url_for "/foo", :full  # Returns "http://example.com/myapp/foo"

If you're subclassing <code>Sinatra::Base</code>, then you need to call
<code>helpers</code> manually:

  class MyApp < Sinatra::Base
    helpers Sinatra::UrlForHelper
    # ...
  end

Thanks to "cypher23" on #mephisto and the folks on #rack for pointing me in
the right direction.  If this gem fails to work correctly on your web
system, please feel free to submit patches and/or bug reports!
